# Exhaust port-merge stabilization — small-plenum approach (PARTIAL)

_2026-05-29. Stage 2 of the exhaust NaN work (Stage 1 = `9d2b460`)._

## Problem
The generator built each exhaust port-merge (2 valve ports + 1 primary header
meeting at one node) as a **plenumless Type-12 Riemann junction**
(`_create_branch_junction`). Under exhaust blowdown this junction diverged to
NaN and aborted the run within ~3 % of the first cycle.

## Root cause (confirmed on Linux, clean run `base.log`, 4000 RPM / WOT)
Failure chain:
1. The cylinder→exhaust-valve boundary momentarily computes an unphysical
   near-vacuum / cryogenic state — `INFO: Calculated pressure at E.O.:
   0.100 bar`, `temperature at E.O.: −82.8 °C`. **This is the seed.**
2. `Sonic condition in boundary: 51` (the cyl-3 exhaust-valve / port node).
3. **Negative density** at the `Port_Ex_3` pipes' valve-side node
   (`U[0] = −1.33e-04`); the `Transforma2Area` floored-density/pressure guards
   catch it (these are the `floored non-physical …` warnings).
4. Cascade to **NaN** at `Port_Ex_3_1/2` and `Header_3`.

The Type-12 junction is an **amplifier** (one Riemann state shared by 3 pipe
ends), but the **seed is the cylinder→exhaust-valve boundary**, upstream of it.

## What the small-plenum change does — and does not — fix
Per-cylinder port-merge is now a small 0D plenum instead of a Type-12 junction.

- `models.py`: `ExhaustConfig.port_junction_vol` (cc), default **20**.
- `wam_generator.py`, `_generate_full_exhaust`: per-cylinder plenum
  `PortJunc_Ex_{n}` of `port_junction_vol/1e6` m³ via
  `_add_plenum(..., allow_small=True)`. The two `Port_Ex` pipes attach at
  end 1, the `Header` at end 0, via `_add_con_plenum_pipe_v2` (now returns its
  connection id). `allow_small=True` bypasses the global 50 cc clamp and uses a
  0.1 cc absolute floor.

### Measured at 4000 RPM / WOT (60 s budget, ~3–6 % reached)
| port_junction_vol | BC-NaN | Sonic | floored | no-mass | abort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plenumless Type-12 (before) | hundreds → abort | flooding | many | — | — |
| **20 cc** | **8** | 0 | 40 | 0 | 0 |
| 50 cc | 102 | 203 | 40 | 0 | 0 |
| 100 cc | 44 | 0 | 40 | 0 | 0 |

**Conclusions:**
- The junction plenum is a large, real improvement (hundreds → single digits)
  and **20 cc is the best volume** (bigger is not better — 50 cc is worse).
- It is **NOT a complete fix**: a residual ~8 BC-NaN remain, and `floored = 40`
  is **constant across all volumes**, which confirms the residual seed is
  upstream of the junction — the **cylinder→exhaust-valve boundary** producing
  negative density at the port's valve-side node (step 1 above), independent of
  junction volume.
- Plenums 7 → 13 (one per cylinder); pipes unchanged (75).

## Stage 3 (DONE, partial): fixed the seed — `ae8fb14`
Confirmed the seed and fixed it at the source. Two commits beyond Stage 2:

### 3a. Cold-start cylinder over-expansion (the real seed)
`INFO: Calculated ... at E.O.` instrumentation (4000 RPM/WOT, 6-cycle smoke)
showed the cryogenic state is a **first-cycle startup artifact, not a steady
defect**:
- cyl 4, cycle 1: **0.100 bar / −82.8 °C (~190 K)** ← seed
- cyl 1, cycle 2: **0.917 bar / +45 °C** ← already healthy

Root cause: OpenWAM imposes one initial condition (`P=1.013 bar, M=0.6 g`) on
**every** cylinder regardless of its crank angle at t=0. A cylinder starting
near TDC (tiny volume) holds an unphysically cold charge; its first expansion
integrates to a near-vacuum. Fix (`TCilindro4T::ActualizaPropiedades`): floor
the converged cylinder temperature to **250 K** and let the existing lines
rebuild `P` and sound speed consistently. Real gas exchange never approaches
the floor, so steady operation is untouched.

### 3b. Density/pressure consistency clamp (`TTubo::Transforma2Area`)
The Stage-1 density and pressure floors fire **independently**, so a cell could
end up with floored density `~1e-8` yet a finite floored pressure — a
thermodynamically inconsistent pair (implies ~infinite T) giving an
astronomical sound speed, which collapsed the CFL timestep to ~6e-14 and
aborted with "plenum too small". Fix: bound density from below for the current
pressure so a floored vacuum cell has a physical sound speed (≤ ~1029 m/s),
scaling species partial densities to preserve mass fractions.

### Measured effect (4000 RPM/WOT, 6-cycle smoke, `port_junction_vol=20`)
| stage | BC-NaN | Sonic | abort timestep | failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stage 2 (seed unfixed) | 41 | 0 | — (timeout) | network-wide NaN incl. intake pipe 10 |
| + 3a cold-start floor | 20 | 0 | 6.6e-14 | `plenum 7 too small` (CFL collapse) |
| + 3b consistency clamp | **12** | 0 | **1.96e-7** | `StudyInflowOutflowMass` (cociente≥2) |

The intake cascade is **gone**; remaining NaN are local to the exhaust port
nodes (pipes 45/46) and the abort is no longer NaN/CFL but the **0D junction
plenum mass-flux limit** (`StudyInflowOutflowMass`, `TOpenWAM.cpp:2526`:
mass into the 20cc plenum > 2× its mass in one step).

## Stage 4 (in progress): junction architecture — small-plenum vs plenumless
The `cociente≥2` abort is intrinsic to a *tiny 0D plenum* absorbing blowdown
flux; enlarging it hurts wave fidelity, and the small plenums also shrink the
timestep so much the 480-point sweep was projected at **25–33 h @ 8×** (old
pre-seed-fix data). A **plenumless Type-12 Riemann junction** has no
mass-storage stability limit and no timestep penalty — it only diverged before
because of the cold-start seed, which is now fixed.

`wam_generator._generate_full_exhaust` now selects topology by
`exhaust.port_junction_vol`:
- `> 0`  → small 0D plenum per cylinder (Stage 2 behaviour);
- `<= 0` → plenumless Type-12 (ports + header share one branch junction; plenum
  count returns 13→7).

### A/B result (4000 RPM/WOT, 6-cycle, seed fixed) — plenumless WINS
| topology | NaN | Sonic | abort | failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small plenum 20cc | 12 | 0 | **yes** | `StudyInflowOutflowMass` (cociente≥2) |
| small plenum 50cc | 102 | 203 | no | timestep crawl (133 h/sweep) |
| small plenum 100cc | 44 | 0 | no | timestep crawl (133 h/sweep) |
| small plenum 200cc | **0** | 0 | **yes** | `StudyInflowOutflowMass` |
| **plenumless Type-12** | **0** | 135 (all guarded) | **none** | — (stable) |

The small-plenum approach aborts or crawls at *every* volume. Plenumless
Type-12 is **stable with zero NaN and zero aborts** — the Stage-1
`TCCRamificacion` guards (entropy-ratio fallback, sound-speed floor, guarded
normal shock) handle the 135 sonic events cleanly, and the seed fix removed the
NaN that originally motivated the plenum. **Decision: default to plenumless
Type-12** (`port_junction_vol = 0`).

## Stage 5 (in progress): the runtime "hang" was a Zeno timestep collapse
A step-resolved trace (`OPENWAM_DTSTEP=N`, commit `2cf2c97`) overturned the
"slow run" assumption. The flow solver is fast (**0.28 ms/step single-thread,
27 % of 2 cycles reached in 0.2 s wall**). The run then **freezes at one crank
angle**: at the cyl-3 exhaust blowdown (**Theta ≈ 847 deg, pacing pipe =
Port_Ex_3**) the global timestep `dt = Courant·dx/VTotalMax` collapses to
**exactly 0** while the main loop spins (48 000+ steps at the same Theta, no
wall-clock progress). Not slowness — a Zeno deadlock.

### Cause chain (confirmed by gdb backtraces + warning trace)
1. The **cyl-3 exhaust-valve boundary** (`TCCCilindro::FlujoSalienteCilindro`,
   Type-8) emits a pathological characteristic pair (Landa/Beta) during the
   supercritical blowdown. `TransformaContorno` turns the huge `(L−B)` into a
   velocity of **Mach ~90 (V = 3–5e4 m/s)** at the port's valve-side node.
2. `VTotalMax = |v| + a` diverges → `dt → 0`.
3. The density floor in `Transforma2Area` only caught `U[0] ≤ 0`, so the tiny-
   but-positive floored density next to finite momentum re-inflated `V`.

### What the velocity clamp fixes (commit `2cf2c97`)
Bounding `|V|` to Mach ~5 in `Transforma2Area` (rebuilding momentum+energy)
**removes the `dt=0` freeze** — the run advances past Theta 847 again. But the
**valve boundary still emits the bad state every blowdown** (the clamp fires
~20×/cyl-3 event), so a residual remains:

| topology (2-cycle, all guards) | NaN | abort | dt=0 freeze |
|---|---|---|---|
| plenumless Type-12 | 92 | 0 | broken, but NaN at cyl-3 junction |
| small plenum 30 cc | **0** | **0** | still Zeno-frozen (~step 850) |
| small plenum 50 cc | 0 | 1 | abort (StudyInflowOutflowMass) |

The 30 cc plenum + velocity clamp reaches **zero NaN / zero abort**, but the
underlying valve-boundary velocity explosion still stalls the timestep. **The
true root cause is the exhaust-valve boundary (`TCCCilindro`) producing a
supersonic / near-vacuum port state at cyl-3 blowdown** — every guard so far
(`Transforma2Area` density/pressure/velocity floors) is downstream
firefighting. Next: fix the seed in `FlujoSalienteCilindro` (bound the emitted
characteristic / throat state to the physical post-shock solution), not the
pipe cells.

### Diagnostics added (`2cf2c97`, opt-in, zero cost when unset)
- `OPENWAM_DTDIAG=1` — per-1%-progress: `dt`, pacing pipe, `ms/step`
  (separates step-count from per-step cost).
- `OPENWAM_DTSTEP=N` — every N steps: `dt`/`Theta`/pacing pipe, independent of
  the progress gate, so a `dt→0` stall is visible even when % is frozen.

## Logging / safety
- `TTubo::ComunicacionTubo_CC` BC-NaN `printf` is bounded by a **thread-safe
  `std::atomic<int>`** (cap 50 each for LEFT/RIGHT). The pipe loop is
  OpenMP-parallel; the earlier plain `static int` was a benign race that still
  bounded output, now made correct.
- `scripts/run_safe.sh <wam> <log> [timeout_s] [maxbytes]` — capped runner
  (`timeout` + `head -c`). The hard guarantee against a disk-flooding run.
- `scripts/smoke_sp.py [rpm] [cycles] [timeout]` — end-to-end smoke that
  generates, runs (log in /tmp, capped), and prints health + a verdict.
- `scripts/vol_scan.py [budget_s] [vols_csv]` — sweeps `port_junction_vol` and
  reports NaN/progress per volume.

## Environment gotchas (remote container)
- Never `pgrep -f` / `pkill -f` on `OpenWAM` or `claude`: the pattern matches
  this agent's own argv (which embeds the whole system prompt, megabytes) and
  pollutes output / can self-kill the shell. Use `pkill -x OpenWAM`.
- A diverging run + unbounded logging = OOM. Always run via `run_safe.sh` or
  `smoke_sp.py` (both cap the log).
- Do **not** batch dependent steps in one parallel tool block: if any command
  in the block exits non-zero, all siblings are cancelled (this repeatedly
  wiped out edits/commits during development).
